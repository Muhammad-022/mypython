# Day 8: Type Casting in Python

Type casting means converting one data type into another data type.

In Python, type casting is commonly used when we want to:
- Convert user input into numbers
- Perform calculations
- Change data for output or storage

## Why Type Casting Is Important
- Input from `input()` is always a string
- Calculations require numeric data
- Helps avoid errors in programs
- Makes programs flexible and dynamic

## Common Type Casting Functions

### int()
Converts a value into an integer.

Example:
int("10") → 10

### float()
Converts a value into a floating-point number.

Example:
float("3.5") → 3.5

### str()
Converts a value into a string.

Example:
str(100) → "100"

## Real-Life Use Case
When a user enters a number using input(), Python treats it as a string.
Type casting helps convert it into a number so calculations can be performed.
