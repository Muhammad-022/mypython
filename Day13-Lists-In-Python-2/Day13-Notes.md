# Day 13: Lists in Python 2

Lists are one of the most important data structures in Python. They are **ordered**, **mutable**, and can store items of different data types. This continuation covers **accessing, modifying, adding, removing items**, and some **useful built-in functions**.

## 1. Accessing Items
* You can access items in a list using **index numbers**. Python uses zero-based indexing, which means the first item has index `0`.  
* Negative indices can be used to access items from the end of the list.

## 2. Modifying Items
* Lists are mutable, which means their items can be changed after creation.<br>
* To modify an item, specify its index and assign a new value.<br>

## 3. Adding Items
* New items can be added to a list using append() or insert():<br>

1. append(value) → adds the item at the end of the list<br>
2. insert(index, value) → adds the item at a specific position<br>

## 4. Removing Items
* Items can be removed using remove() or pop():<br>

1. remove(value) → removes an item by value<br>
2. pop() → removes the last item by default or an item at a specific index if provided<br>

## 5. Useful Functions with Lists
* Python provides some built-in functions to manipulate lists:<br>

1. len(list) → returns the number of items in the list<br>
2. sort() → sorts the list in ascending order<br>
3. reverse() → reverses the current order of the list<br>
