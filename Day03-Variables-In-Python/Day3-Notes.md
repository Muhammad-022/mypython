# Variables in Python

## What is a Variable?
A variable is a container used to store data in a program.
It allows us to save values and use them later.

In Python, a variable is created when a value is assigned to it.

Example:
x = 10
name = "Ahmad"

## Why Do We Use Variables?
Variables are used to:
- Store information
- Reuse values in a program
- Make code readable and understandable
- Change values easily
- Perform calculations

Without variables, programming would be very difficult.

## How Variables Work
When you assign a value to a variable, Python stores that value in memory
and links it with the variable name.

Example:
age = 20

Here:
- age → variable name
- 20 → value

## Rules for Naming Variables
- Must start with a letter or underscore (_)
- Cannot start with a number
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Cannot use Python keywords
- Variable names are case-sensitive

Valid examples:
age = 20  
user_name = "Ahmad"  
_totalMarks = 100  

Invalid examples:
1name = "Ahmad"  
my-name = 10  
class = 4


## Types of Variables (Basic)

### Integer (int)
Stores whole numbers.
Example:
age = 20

### Float (float)
Stores decimal numbers.
Example:
price = 99.5

### String (str)
Stores text.
Example:
name = "Ahmad"

### Boolean (bool)
Stores True or False.
Example:
is_student = True

## Updating Variable Values
Variables can be updated anytime.

Example:
score = 50
score = 80

## Checking Variable Type
Use type() to check the data type.

Example:
type(age)

## Conclusion
Variables are the building blocks of Python.
They help store data, manage information, and make programs useful.
