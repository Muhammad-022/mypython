# Day 5: Comments in Python

Comments are used to explain code and make it easier to understand.
They are ignored by the Python interpreter and do not affect program execution.

## Why Comments Are Used
Comments are helpful to:
- Explain what the code does
- Make code readable
- Help others understand the logic
- Remember code functionality later

## Types of Comments in Python

### Single-line Comments
Single-line comments start with the `#` symbol.

Example:
```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, Python")
