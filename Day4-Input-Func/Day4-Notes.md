# Day 4: Input Function in Python

The `input()` function is used to take input from the user during program execution.
It allows the program to receive data directly from the user.

The input is always received as a string, even if the user enters numbers.
This input can later be converted into other data types when needed.

## Why `input()` is Used
The `input()` function is used to:
- Take user data at runtime
- Avoid hard-coded values
- Build dynamic and flexible programs

## Advantages of Using `input()`
- Improves user interaction
- Makes programs more realistic
- Allows different outputs for different users
- Useful in real-world applications like forms and calculators

## Example
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Welcome", name)
