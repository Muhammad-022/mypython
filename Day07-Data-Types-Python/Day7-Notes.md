# Day 7: Data Types in Python

In Python, data types define the type of data that a variable can store.
They help Python understand how the data should be stored, processed, and used.

Every value in Python belongs to a specific data type.

## Why Data Types Are Important

Data types are important because they:
- Tell Python how much memory to allocate
- Decide what operations can be performed on data
- Help avoid errors in programs
- Make code more organized and understandable

## Common Data Types in Python

### 1. Integer (int)
Integers are whole numbers without any decimal point.

Examples:
- 5
- 10
- -25

Integers are commonly used for counting, age, quantity, and numbers.

### 2. Floating Point (float)
Float data type is used for decimal numbers.

Examples:
- 3.14
- 5.5
- 10.0

Floats are used when more precision is needed, such as height, weight, or price.

### 3. String (str)
Strings are used to store text.
They are written inside single or double quotes.

Examples:
- "Hello"
- "Python"
- "Ahmad"

Strings are used for names, messages, and textual data.

### 4. Boolean (bool)
Boolean data type has only two values:
- True
- False

It is mainly used in conditions and decision-making.

Examples:
- is_student = True
- is_logged_in = False

## Conclusion

Understanding data types is a basic and important step in learning Python.
They help in writing correct, efficient, and meaningful programs.
