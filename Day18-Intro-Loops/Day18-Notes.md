# Day 18: Loops in Python (Introduction)

## What is a Loop?
A loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
Instead of writing the same code again and again, loops help us automate repetition.

Loops make programs:
- Shorter
- Cleaner
- More efficient

## Why Loops Are Used
Loops are useful when:
- You want to repeat a task
- You want to process multiple values
- You want to work with lists, ranges, or conditions

Without loops, repeating tasks would be difficult and messy.

## Types of Loops in Python
Python mainly provides two types of loops:
1. `for` loop
2. `while` loop

## for Loop (Basic Idea)
A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as:
- list
- tuple
- string
- range of numbers

The loop runs once for each item in the sequence.

### Basic Structure of a for Loop
```python
for variable in sequence:
    code to repeat

Variable takes the value of each item one by one
Sequence can be a list or range
The indented code runs repeatedly
