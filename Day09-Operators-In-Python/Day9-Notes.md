# Day 9: Operators in Python

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.
They are used to calculate, compare, and make decisions in programs.

- +  Addition
- -  Subtraction
- *  Multiplication

These operators return True or False.

### 3. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditions.

Example:
x > 5 and x < 10

## Why Operators Are Important
- Perform calculations
- Compare values
- Make decisions
- Control program flow
